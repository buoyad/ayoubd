A couple friends and I have been competing on the New York Times mini crossword
for around 8 (!) years. We have sent probably thousands of completion
screenshots to each other, but sadly our long history of scores have never been
collated and are lost in the ebbs and flows of new devices and iCloud backups.
But no longer!

[Tally](https://tally.ayoubd.com) is an application
to store and compare completion times for the New York Times mini crossword, and
possibly other puzzles in the future. I'm writing Tally using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as a full stack framework.
I'm working on a writeup of how I created it and the challenges along the way
(authentication, woof... SSR, whoa!), but in the mean time you can check out the
source code [here](https://github.com/buoyad/tally).
