A couple friends and I have been competing on the New York Times mini crossword
for around 8 (!) years. We have sent probably thousands of completion
screenshots to each other, but sadly our long history of scores have never been
collated and are lost in the ebbs and flows of new devices and iCloud backups.
But no longer!

[Tally](https://tally.ayoubd.com) is an application to store and compare
completion times for the New York Times mini crossword, and possibly other
puzzles in the future. I'm writing Tally using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as
a full stack framework. I'm working on a writeup of how I created it and the
challenges along the way (authentication, woof... SSR, whoa!), but in the mean
time you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/buoyad/tally).

Make an account! Start logging some times! Check out our scores at our
[tournament page](https://tally.ayoubd.com/tournaments/cwtracks).
