I built this site using a Node.js Typescript server and a Next.js client. When I
was building the [chat](/work#chat) feature, I decided to use websockets for
easily extensible real-time communication between the server and client. With
this setup, I wouldn't need to create new endpoints for every type of operation,
and could just pass messages with different `type`s across the wire. However,
things quickly got unwieldy when I built the initial version of chat without any
typings on the websocket.
