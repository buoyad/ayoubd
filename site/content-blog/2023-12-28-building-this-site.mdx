Starting greenfield projects is a rare opportunity. Finally, an opportunity to
leave all the tech debt of previous projects behind, and write new code
unburdened by years of mistakes and built up hacks. Like opening a brand new line of credit.

When I was deciding to do a website refresh, it was daunting to decide on how to
build it. My previous website was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
which served me and many others very well for many years, but like Joaquin
Phoenix when he started talking to his computer in *her*, I wanted more.

In particular, I wanted to be able to add dynamic content, this blog's view
counts being a perfect example. My requirements for a new site were:


1. Don't be constrained by an opinionated framework / site generator
2. Be built with familiar technologies that I already use in my professional
   work (i.e. not ruby)
3. Serve as a playground for anything I want to add, whether that needs dynamic
   rendering or not
4. Simplify integrating client-side javascript on pages without needing to spin
   up a separate project to get typescript and react
