I'm currently in the midst of a site rewrite, and while I'm planning on a more
full post describing my process and decisions, I thought I'd write up a more
bite-sized chunk people may find useful.

For a while during this rewrite, the header design consisted of just the
navigation links with `position: sticky` and `backdrop-filter`s applied to blur
the content underneath. I thought this was a bit underwhelming for what I was
going for, and I was feeling inspired after reading
[Chris Nicholas's](https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/a-new-blog-for-2024) site
refresh blog post and some of the discussion about
[website headers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38842116) on the HN post.

I didn't set out to make a header very similar to Chris's, but it did turn out
to match pretty well with his design brief of _aurora_, coming at it from a
different direction.

## Process

I started out taking inspiration from my opengraph image:

<Image
  className="w-5/6 self-center rounded"
  src="/images/2024-1-3-aurora-header/og.png"
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  alt="This site's opengraph image, which is a picture of me smiling at the camera in a circular frame beside the text 'Danny Ayoub'."
/>

The idea is to take the yellow wave gradients, flip them, and set them behind
the navigation links like so:

<Image
  className="w-5/6 self-center rounded"
  src="/images/2024-1-3-aurora-header/fig-1.png"
  width={1102}
  height={240}
  alt="An example image showing this site's navigation header with two overlapping wavy SVGs with translucent gradient fills."
/>

Going further, we can animate them in CSS using `background-position` to give
them a more dynamic look. This means our SVGs will need to tile horizontally.

### Creating the SVGs

SVG has a number of benefits for a use-case like this. It's a vector format, so
it will scale to any devices the page will appear on without pixelation. Also,
once you are familiar with
[SVG syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), it's fairly easy
to make minor changes directly in your code editor rather than having to start
over from your vector software.

My vector editor of choice is [Figma](https://figma.com). To start, I created a
frame with roughly the same aspect ratio I was going for, and with 2x my
header's height.

<Image
  className="w-5/6 self-center rounded"
  src="/images/2024-1-3-aurora-header/fig-2.png"
  width={1670}
  height={334}
  alt="A Figma screenshot showing a 700x112 frame with a wavy path with a translucent gradient fill inside it."
/>

To this, add the wavy path that contains the gradient fill. To make the path
tile, the right-side border of the frame needs to be identical to the left-side
border. To accomplish this, copy the two path vertices that cross the frame's
boundary on the left side and move them to the right side of the frame (being
careful to keep them at the same height). Then, attach the floating vertices to
the rest of the path, and make a boundary outside of the frame so the path is
closed and can hold the gradient fill.

The gradient also needs to tile. To do this, make the fill a linear gradient
that is perfectly horizontal with three stops: one on the left border of the
frame, one somewhere in the middle, and one on the right border.

<Image
  className="w-5/6 self-center rounded"
  src="/images/2024-1-3-aurora-header/fig-3.png"
  width={1924}
  height={1438}
  alt="A Figma screenshot showing a 700x112 frame with a wavy path with a translucent gradient fill inside it."
/>

Then, set the leftmost stop and the rightmost stop to the same color and
opacity.  
ðŸŽ‰ Ta-da! An SVG that perfectly tiles horizontally.

I made two of these SVGs with different curves and gradients to overlap later on
in the layout.

### The CSS

To accomplish the ethereal blobby-ness of my header, I use a combination of 2
SVGs, CSS filters, and a CSS animation. Here is the relevant CSS:

```css title="nav.tsx"
@keyframes rotateHue {
  from {
    filter: hue-rotate(0deg) blur(10px);
    background-position: 0 0;
  }
  to {
    filter: hue-rotate(360deg) blur(10px);
    background-position: 700px 0;
  }
}

.nav-background-1 {
  animation: rotateHue 60s linear infinite;
}

.nav-background-2 {
  animation: rotateHue 30s linear -9s reverse infinite;
}
```

Reversing the second animation makes the background images move in opposite
directions, and setting a `-9s` delay makes the animation start with them
already having different values for `hue-rotate` for a bit more of a random
feel. I set the `blur` inside the animation, rather than in the SVG or in
separate CSS for two reasons

- It was harder not to have a repeat boundary line when adding the blur as an
  SVG filter
- It's impossible to set it in separate CSS without having the animation
  `filter` property overwrite it, or vice versa

Here's a screen recording of the final product, with the animation sped up.

<Image
  className="w-5/6 self-center rounded"
  src="/images/2024-1-3-aurora-header/final.gif"
  width={1136}
  height={252}
  alt="A gif of a screen recording of this site's animated header, sped up to make it easier to see the animation"
/>

## Wishlist

A couple ways this could be improved:

1. Programmatically generate the background images - this would be awesome! The
   SVGs are fairly simple `path`s, and could most likely be generated at request
   time no sweat, or definitely at build time. If I was more well-versed in
   generating bezier curves, I'd try this.
2. More layers - it'd be interesting to experiment with the number of layers.
   The current product looks a bit like a lava lamp owing to the two layers.

DId you implement something on this list?

That's all for now! See you next time (on a more fully functioning site) for a
writeup of how this site works.
