May 2020 - October 2021
Zoom Video Communications
Security Engineer

Bringing end-to-end encryption to Zoom products.

Hardware Security Modules - Architected and deployed the intermediate CA that stores trusted server signing keys in hardware security modules (HSMs), enabling potential clients with high security compliance requirements to consider Zoom products. Implemented an ACME client that interfaces with DigiCert CA and automatically rotates certificates.
As described in section 7.6.1 of the cryptography whitepaper.

Cross-region communication - System that allows keyservers to communicate with each other across regions, allowing customers with data residency requirements to upgrade to end-to-end encrypted products.
Monitoring - Build Grafana dashboards and prometheus alert configurations to monitor deployments and scheduled jobs and alert on-call engineers when issues arise, increasing S/N ratio of alerts to approach 100%, and enabling near perfect uptime guarantee.

September 2017 - May 2020
Keybase
Software Engineer

At Keybase I was mainly on the desktop team working on the cross-platform Keybase app. One codebase was used to build apps for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.

Teams tab redesign - Led a team of 4 engineers in re-implementing 30+ screens using a cohesive design system. Worked closely with design and core teams to create a consistent library of 100+ components, hooks, and API protocols to serve as the foundation for future development.
Exploding messages - Implemented the cryptographically sound exploding messages UI, which allows users to send messages that disappear after a set time. Integrated animations and timers into an already complex chat UI that continued to grow around it for 2+ years without breaking. Ensured no data was kept in frontend memory after the message expired.
Cryptocurrency Integration - Took initiative in studying Stellar cryptocurrency protocol ahead of valuable partnership project, enabling faster development and allowing Keybase to be the first full-featured Stellar wallet. Designed and implemented the protocol for sending payments integrating security features such as payment confirmation and nonces to prevent replay attacks and accidental double spends.

General professional information:

Regarding his professional philosophy, he tries to keep good opinions that guide him in the right direction, but also keep an open mind and be willing to explore in any new directions that may lead to a better outcome.
He also likes to have fun, and never take things too seriously. He believes that you can often reach a better solution by being light hearted and playful.
In previous roles, he enjoyed playing video games with coworkers. He highly values a considerate and caring work environment.
His most proud professional achievements are the certificate rotation system he built at zoom, and the exploding messages UI at Keybase, as well as emoji reactions at keybase and designing and building the engine that powers all Keybase's text autocompletion features.
The exploding messages UI was quite complex, and lived in the complex evolving environment of the chat view, yet it hardly ever needed updating in the years since implementation.
